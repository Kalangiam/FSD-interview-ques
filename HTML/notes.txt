1. Tag -A tag is a snippet of code enclosed in angle brackets < > that specifies how content should be formatted or styled

2. Element - An element consists of a pair of tags (an opening tag and a closing tag), along with the content that falls between them.

3. Attribute - An attribute is a modifier that provides additional information about an HTML element. Attributes are specified within the opening tag of an element and consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign (=).

4. Block Level Element - A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
   A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

5. Inline Elements - An inline element does not start on a new line. An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary. This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.

6. Semantic Element - A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. 
Examples of non-semantic elements: 
    <div>
    <span> - Tells nothing about its content. 
Examples of semantic elements: 
    <form>, 
    <table>,
    <article>
    <aside>
    <details>
    <figcaption>
    <figure>
    <footer>
    <header>
    <article> - Clearly defines its content.

7. HTML Entities - HTML entities start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). They can be represented in two main ways:
    - Named Entities (&lt;)
    - Numeric Entities (&#169;)

8. <div> (Division) - The <div> element is a block-level element that is used to create divisions or sections within an HTML document.

9. <span> - The <span> element is an inline-level element that is used to apply styles or markup to a specific portion of text within a larger block of content.
